% Define the column width and poster size
% To set effective sepwid, onecolwid and twocolwid values, first choose how many columns you want and how much separation you want between columns
% The separation I chose is 0.024 and I want 4 columns
% Then set onecolwid to be (1-(4+1)*0.024)/4 = 0.22
% Set twocolwid to be 2*onecolwid + sepwid = 0.464

            [Sentence on video games as a useful tool in both education and in computer science education] [Introduce CISC374 as a course which aims to combine both of these goals] [Sentence on the emphasis on educational game development, working with CCCS] [Elaborate on CCCS, talk about their income level, the donation of XOs] [Pivot back to the use as an educational tool in software engineering for college juniors/seniors] To help this course achieve its goals, we have developed a set of tools to help address some difficulties and limitations in the tools previously available.

    \begin{block}{Development Platform}
        \rmfamily{
            The primary development platform is the OLPC XO, as they are the most readily available platform at the target middle school. To allow for rapid development in one semester, and because it is the favored language on the OLPC XO, Python was chosen as the language to be used in the class. Lastly, because it is preinstalled and because the lack of hardware support in the operating system eliminates most other options, Pygame was chosen as the graphics library to be used in the course.
		}
	\end{block}

    \begin{block}{Spyral}
        \rmfamily{
    		Spyral is a 2D sprite-based engine [built on top of pygame?] designed to allow the rapid development of games, particularly those targetted at low performance platforms. It started as a library to optimize drawing during an early semester of the course, and grew to include many more features that previously had to be written by each team individually. [Perhaps a note on why we have to use pygame?] Spyral now includes modules to handle:
    		\begin{itemize}
    			\item Scenes, for game organization
    			\item Images, for loading and drawing graphics in a consistent way
    			\item Sprites
    			\item Fonts
    			\item Event Handling
    			\item Vectors
    			\item Rectangles
    			\item Animations
    			\item Clock
    		\end{itemize}
            
            In addition to providing tools for making game development easier, spyral also works to teach and encourage better software engineering practices to the users, targetting places where poor decisions were routinely made in the past. In particular, the use of a scene system encourages the separation of content into disjoint pieces where possible, and the event system is designed to mimick and be used like modern event driven systems for games, networking software, and parallel software.

	  \begin{alertblock}{Conclusion}
	    \rmfamily{As seen from the figures, the theory is a good approximation to experiment, but some corrections need to be made. In terms of our MEMS devices, we see that the theory does not accurately describe $\lambda^*$ for high voltages. Thus, using the theory alone to design MEMS devices will lead to a smaller range of stable device operation. In order to increase this range and get the most out of the devices, we must obtain a more accurate theoretical description of $\lambda^*$. This may done by eliminating some of the approximations made in the derivation of equation \eqref{MEMSeq}.

%    \begin{column}{\threecolwid}					  % create a three-column-wide column and then we will split it up later
%      \begin{block}{Altering Column Spans}
%        \rmfamily{You can make columns that span multiple other columns relatively easily. Lengths are defined in the template that make columns look normal-ish if you want to use a four-column layout like this poster. If you want to use a different number of columns, you will have to modify those lengths accordingly at the top of the poster.tex file.
%        
%        In particular, near the top of the TeX file you will see lines that look like:
%        \begin{semiverbatim}
%          \hskip1ex\\setlength\{\\sepwid\}\{0.024\\paperwidth\}
%          
%          \hskip1ex\\setlength\{\\onecolwid\}\{0.22\\paperwidth\}
%          
%          \hskip1ex\\setlength\{\\twocolwid\}\{0.464\\paperwidth\}
%          
%          \hskip1ex\\setlength\{\\threecolwid\}\{0.708\\paperwidth\}
%        \end{semiverbatim}}
%        
%        Set ``sepwid'' to be some small length somewhere near 0.025 (this is the space between columns). Then if $n$ is the number of columns you want, you should set
%        \begin{align*}
%          \text{onecolwid} & = \frac{1}{n}(1-(n+1)\times\text{sepwid}), \\
%          \text{twocolwid} & = 2\times\text{onecolwid} + \text{sepwid}, \\
%          \text{threecolwid} & = 3\times\text{onecolwid} + 2\times\text{sepwid}.

%            \rmfamily{For the standard blocks there are two colours; one for the title and one for the block body:\\

%            The \emph{fg} colour sets the text colour and \emph{bg} sets the background colour.
%            For the normal blocks it makes no sense to use a background colour other than white. You \emph{can} change it, but it will look weird!}
